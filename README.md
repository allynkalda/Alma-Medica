# Patients List App

This app shows a list of patients. The user can add a new entry by inputting the id, name, surname, and birthdate of the patient after clicking the 'Add Patient' button. The user can also delete the entry by clicking the button to the right in the table.

Used `react-hooks-form` for the form creation and `yup` for form validation. Used Material UI for the components and React Testing Library for unit testing.
